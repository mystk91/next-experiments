These are Hover Menu's that can appear on any side of an element. You can control their offset and how much they are shifted. 

You could easily refactor this for onClick instead of mouseOver. 

HoverMenuWrapper surrounds a child you want to have a menu.
HoverMenu isn't a wrapper, and must be placed inside the element you want to have a menu.
